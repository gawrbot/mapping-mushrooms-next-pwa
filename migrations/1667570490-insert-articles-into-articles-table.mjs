The cheeks, nape, and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. The legs are black, as is the short stout bill. The irises of adults are greyish or silvery-white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age. The sexes look alike, though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before moulting.',

When they are white, they are often simply called button mushrooms. When they are brown, they are often sold as chestnut mushrooms. Once they are mature, they are actually marketed as Portobello mushrooms. Their cap will have enlarged quite a bit and range between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) in size in this state. This mushroom has a particularly complicated taxonomic history compared to other fungi. It has been in the Agaricus genus since 1946. Be careful when foraging these mushrooms since they have deadly look-alikes. For example, the Destroying Angel mushroom in the Amanita genus looks similar to button mushrooms. You can tell the difference by opening up the mushroom. The button mushroom should have pinkish or brown gills, while the Destroying Angel has pure white gills. China produces the vast majority of these mushrooms that supply the world‚Äôs kitchens. It grew 8.94 million tons in 2019.

Specific industries also utilize oyster mushrooms in mycoremediation of polluted areas. The genus of the oyster mushrooms translates to mean ‚Äòside ear‚Äô because of their shape. They often grow in decaying hardwood trees. Another factor that makes them unusual is their capacity to be a weak parasite of living herbaceous plants.

      'Deadly Conocybe is an innocent-looking mushroom, if there ever was one. It has a long, thin stem topped with a delicate-looking cap. It has a ring that forms about halfway up the stem, which helps identify it. These mushrooms are a common lawn mushroom, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Although innocent in appearance, these belong to the same group of poisonous mushrooms that the Death Cap mushroom is in. They most closely resemble mushrooms in the Psilocybe genus because of a similar cap. The latter are psychedelic mushrooms and rarely harmful long-term.',

Instead, they wreak long-term damage that is difficult to notice until years later. The mushroom gets its name from the saddle shape that the mushroom has once it matures.
